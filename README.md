    About the Project
</h2>
    
<p>
    This here is my updated portfolio. It was all made using HTML and CSS with even a little Javascript. Eventually this portfolio will include all of my work as a web developer and audio engineer.

    The way I chose to approach this was simplicity. I wanted to keep things clean and minimal, yet smooth. Orange is my favorite color so I figured using a pastel version mixed with some opacity throughout the site would help accomplish that feeling.

<p>
    There are still plenty of challenges for me when it comes to web development, but I felt much more comfortable working on this the second time around. I was able to go back in and adjust things to sit more naturally, as well as update fonts and features.
    
    The main challenge this time around was the Javascript to get the scroll-to-top button working.
