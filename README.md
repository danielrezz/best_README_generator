    Content
</h2>

<p>
    The command-line application to create your new README needs to be invoked by using the following command:

    node index.js
</p>
<br>
<p>
    Once you invoke the app, you will be prompted with a series of questions regarding your project. Answer these as best as possible, as your answers will be the information that populates on your README. When you've made your way through the questions, you will then be granted with the best README file EVER!

    Challenges
</h2>

<p>
    This project was challenging, but not too challenging. I felt like I understood the concepts of working with node and inquirer rather well. The trickiest part was figuring out how to populate ther badge icon on the page based on the user's response. Since this was something not provided in the answers, it took a little (ok, a lot of) extra brain power.
